# 🚀 Advancing DevOps: Scaling Deployments with AWS!

Previously, I automated deployments using GitHub, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and Terraform. Now, I’ve taken it to the next level by enhancing **AWS-based scalability and automation!**

## ✅ What’s New?
- 🔄 **Jenkins** automates the CI/CD pipeline, from code fetch to deployment.
- ⚙️ **Ansible** configures infrastructure and manages deployments.
- 🐳 **Docker** containers package the application efficiently.
- ☁️ **Terraform** provisions AWS infrastructure, including EC2 instances and ALB.
- 🚀 **AWS Auto Scaling** ensures high availability and resource optimization.

## 💡 Challenge Faced & Solution
- 🔐 **Terraform AWS Authentication Issue** – Faced difficulties in managing AWS access and secret keys securely while provisioning infrastructure. Resolved this by configuring **environment variables** and using **Jenkins’ credential management** for secure access.
